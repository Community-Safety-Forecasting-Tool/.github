# Community Safety Forecasting Tool 

There is an inherent relationship between economic conditions and community safety and this project will explore this relationship to provide tools for community to assess the risk with different scenario planning analysis. 

The end goal is to have not only a visualization platform that is useful for trend analysis, but also, through the use of machine learning, be able to forecast community safety given specific features.

The social benefit of this project is giving the ability for community planners as well as people who are involved in their community a way to analyze and forecast the community safety using different economic conditions as well as helping them benchmark with other communities. This can create conversation between community champions as to how we can make our communities a safer place.

Given the scope of this project, the forecasting tool development will be splitted into several micro-project parts:

Micro project 1 [Visualization]: In the first part we will look at ways on how to deliver effective visualization using the datasets. The end goal is to create meaningful visualization that could effectively tell the story of such relationship.

Micro project 2[Feature Selection and Data Quality]: In the second part of the project, we will be selecting the datasets we want to use, features that we consider to be useful as well as cleaning up the data. The end goal is to have a dataset ready for machine learning.

Micro-project 3 [Machine Learning Training and Optimization]: The end goal is to select the model that is best suitable for the data.

Microproject 4 [Web Platform Creation]: Using Flask, the end goal is to have a web platform that can output these visualizations and use the machine learning model to predict the outcomes.
